## General Information

- This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately detect melanoma from skin lesion images. Early detection of melanoma, a dangerous form of skin cancer, can significantly improve survival rates.
- Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of skin cancer. Traditional diagnosis methods rely heavily on manual examination by dermatologists, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Automated systems using deep learning can aid in faster, more accurate detection.
- The goal of this project is to develop a robust CNN-based model that can assist healthcare professionals by accurately identifying melanoma, reducing diagnostic time, and improving patient outcomes.
- The dataset used is the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, which contains labeled images of skin lesions, including both melanoma and benign cases. It is a widely used dataset for melanoma detection research.
